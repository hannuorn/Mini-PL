# Mini-PL
Compilers Project 2020: Mini-PL interpreter

This was a project for Compilers course in University of Helsinki. It implements the front-end parts of a compiler for Mini-PL, a simple programming language designed for pedagogic purposes. 

This Mini-PL interpreter can run valid Mini-PL programs, and give meaningful error messages for invalid programs. It can also print out the abstract syntax tree to demonstrate the operation of the recursive parser.
